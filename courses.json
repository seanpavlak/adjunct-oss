It is used worldwide in calculations and research. Here are some examples of how we measure things using the metric system:\n\nMeter is the unit of measuring distances and lengths. We use this unitLinks to an external site. in our daily life, for example, the distance between school and home, lengthLinks to an external site. of cloth, etc.  \nYou may have noticed that there is a weight mentioned in the bag of your favourite snack. For example, 250 grams of potato chips. Here, gram is the unit of weight.\nSimilarly, on the bottle of your favourite beverage, there's volumeLinks to an external site. mentioned (for example, 250 milliliters of cola). Here, milliliter is the unit of volume.\"\n",
              "response": "Great feedback, exactly in medicine and in science we have widely adopted the metric system as a means of measuring, standardizing, and easily converting between similar units of measure. \n\nThe US education system does somewhat cover the metric system, so I think everyone has a base understanding of it now. Which is a step in the right direction, but as a whole I think most people still are more familiar with the imperial system (inches, gallons, miles, etc.) \n\nWhat's cool is that the metric system is rigidly defined by the speed of light and other universal constants, so unlike the imperial system it is not subject to an arbitrary definition for our measurement tools. \n"

We are one of the most populated countries in the world. I would argue that the people of the United States would throw a fit if the measurement system was changed. We would have to change all road signs. People would have to learn how to read Celcius and apply that information in their everyday lives. We would have to learn to measure completely differently. If we were to actually change to the Metric System, it would take a very long time for the population to adapt. \n\nI also like to think that the US just likes to be different from everyone else. We like to do our own thing and let others adapt to what we have put forward\n\nI have grown up without the metric system. I know very little of the metric system and what the numbers would translate to. \n\nI know nothing about physics. I never took a physics class in my entire educational career. I cannot lie, I am a little worried about this course!\n\n",

So we will learn a little bit about a lot of areas of physics, which can be daunting. However, as long as you keep up with the readings, watch the supplemental materials, and stay on top of your work I'm confident you will make it through and be proud of yourself.\n\n"

I think, it has long since become the standard in the US, and a lot of products still use the imperial system, which might make things more expensive and confusing for many people.   According to what I've observed, the metric system is extensively utilized in the US in the fields of research, health, electronics, the armed forces, vehicle manufacturing and maintenance, and international relations. One recent encounter I had with the metric system was measuring a solution in milliliters during labs.Although I have never taken physics, I now know that it involves things  that studies motion, energy, and matter and is applied to the interactions of the cosmos and the Earth. My friends who have taken the course have told me about their experiences.  Physics interests me because it has applications to everyday life and understanding how the world functions. ",

Since the United States became independent we simply decided to keep the customary system and not convert like everyone else. We would have to spend time reteaching and rewriting all the textbooks to teach the metric systems. Although there are some instances where products in the United States still have the measurements from the system. For example weight at the gym, most will add the weights by the pounds instead of the kilograms, but those from other countries can still understand the weight measurement if they can come to states. Another example is soda cans we have ounces and liters just depending on if it is a can or the bottles they are measured differently.

Schools teach both imperial and metric, but metric isn't used in a day to day life as a kid. Places that use metric are more science based, medicine, auto production and dealing with international measurements.\n\nIn physics, the metric system is mainly used. NASA even switched to the metric system in 1990. I don't have much experience with the metric system, other than dosage calculations with medications. I vaguely remember physics from high school but i'm curious to get back to it. I know ultrasounds have a lot to do with physics and i'm curious to find out the specifics.\n\n",

Dosage calculations and unit conversions are mainly why medicine and the sciences have adopted the metric system. It's good that you have some exposure to physics, its always easier to learn something the second time around."

The most important information I learned this week is the understanding of speed and instantaneous speed. Speed is is the distance traveled divided by the time to let us know how long a trip will take. Instantaneous speed is the rate at which distance is being covered at a given instant time which lets us know how fast something is going in that given time. I am studying to be a Diagnostic Medical Sonographer and I believe speed especially instantaneous speed can help me in my field. In clinical ultrasound we would use speed propagation to detect the distance that the sound wave travels in a given time kind of similar to instantaneous speed. Learning physics is important for sonography but learning basic speed and velocity can help me understand ultrasound speed and velocity and their different formulas.",

If I did not have the formulas I would not be able to convert kph to mph. Though, I am still rusty, I did learn that it was easier to multiply than to divide. When I was dividing, I noticed I kept messing the answer by a few points. Though these specific formulas deal with velocity, time, speed..etc.. learning conversions is important for exact answers. \nExplain why this was important to your learning and how it will help you in your fieldIt is important for me to learn the formulas so we can get the proper unit conversion. I am attending school to be an Sonographer and for certain specialties  it is required to have accurate measurements of the liver, spleen, and organs to ensure if the patient has inflammation or if certain parts are not sized appropriately due to medical conditions. It is also extremely important during OBGYN scans when scanning an embryo/baby as we need to ensure all parts of the baby are growing at a normal rate. I remember when I was pregnant, they measured my baby and said she was not growing . Which I had to have another ultrasound to compare the size of the last ultrasound to determine if the embryo was growing adequately or if the embryo was no longer viable.\nI would also like to include that it is important to know conversions, especially when it comes to traveling. For example, when I was stationed overseas they did not use miles.  I had to ensure that I was driving the proper speed and following the appropriate kph as the vehicles I drove was set to miles and did not have KPH. Though, nowadays there are vehicles that you can switch from miles to KPH, its still good to have that knowledge.   \n\n",

When I am doing unit conversions I always set them up to be cross-multiplied so that I can cancel out units along the way. Also, I totally understand your experience, my wife had a natural delivery and was moving around a lot and one of the ultrasound graphs was reading weirdly. Well, it took a medical professional to come into the room to see how my wife was positioned and that there weren't any issues just that the patient's environment will sometimes effect the results from the machine. Trained professionals need to understand what is happening and why, and need to be able to address what is the root cause of the abnormality."

Newton's Second Law in athletic development would be that children can use force to make their speed better. An example of the second law would be how a child can jump to create a bigger force. Newton's Third Law states that a force will have an equal and opposite reaction and so a child's body in athletic development would be forced by that law. When a child throws a ball in the air, the ball will go forward with the force of the child and will ultimately push the child back due to the action.

              "post": "According to Newton's laws the first one states an object in motion will remain in motion, and an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted upon by a force. In terms of biomechanic's this law helps us understand the relationship between force and motion as a child learns to understand movement. Newton's first law identifies inertia as an object at rest, and inertia is directly related to mass. This law is helpful in improving athletic performance as children grow because they are introduced to movement. For example, a child is done  playing with a toy car, and a teddy bear and decides to throw the toys across the room. Depending on the mass of the two toys, the child will have to exert more force to throw the heavier toy, but in order to create the force necessary to throw the toys the child must demonstrate movement. \n\nNewton's second and third law tells us that the greater the mass of an object the greater the force is required to move it, and for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. For example, a kid is playing with a volleyball and decides to set the ball to themselves by spiking it towards the wall. A kid is able to demonstrate Newton's second law by determining how much force they need to exert in order for the ball to bounce back with enough momentum. The child setting the ball, and the ball bouncing back off the wall, is an example of action-reaction. Action is the production of force, and force is required for motion. Understanding how force and motion enable movement, will improve a child's performance of movement. These laws help develop technique, over strength by allowing the child to learn greater force is needed for a greater momentum.\n\n",

It was interesting to see how the laws apply to children in basic movements of play in everyday life. Inertia is crucial in understanding that an object in motion stays in motion, and an object at rest stays at rest. This explains a lot for movement when it comes to sports. An example of inertia is when a child is starting to ride a bike, he has to exert force by peddling to make the bike start moving forward. With acceleration a child must accelerate the bike forward to keep moving forward if that is the goal. With action reaction the child must continue pedaling forward with strength and force to keep the bike moving. The reaction comes in the form of the pushback from the ground as the tires push backwards to move forward.  \n\n     I learned from the article that as children grow, they tend to get heavier. The children who are heavier have more mass which results in a stronger athlete. Sports can seem easier for children who are bigger, and heavier because with greater mass comes more strength. This strength can serve to throw, swing, kick or run better. Strength is important, but technique is as well. Having strength does not really matter if the technique is not being practiced as well. This is where the coach or instructor can help the students, depending on their level and mass, and place them in the best position to help them advance and be better athletes. A coach can see which children have greater potential due to size and place them in the position that best serves them in a team or as an individual. Also having equipment that is intended for their size and weight is very important as well. A child will perform much better, for example with equipment like balls, bats, and bikes meant for their size and weight.  \n\n",
              "response": "Great points! I would like to add that on top of all that, technique also is a great risk mitigation factor to avoid injury. Understanding the biomechanics and Newton's third law lets us know that any force the child exerts is also exerted on the child, this tells us that we need to understand how to absorb this energy in a efficient way so that it doesn't stress joints and result in injury."

              "post": "1st law (Inertia): When a child is developing motor skills one of the first things they do is throw, pull, or push objects. A great game that will help children improve, is showing how they themselves have a force. That force when acted upon an object like a bowling ball will cause it to move. Without their external force on the bowling ball, the bowling ball will not move and be in a state called inertia. This shows Newton's first law that and how an object will stay at rest unless a force is applied to it. This helps children to gain strength and flexibility when force is being applied to the objects. \n\n2nd law (acceleration): Bowling also helps understand Newton's 2nd law; the force that is projected to the object will make it accelerate just as much. However it also depends on the objects mass, if the mass is greater you will need to apply more force to it to make it accelereate. When you throw a bowling ball it will accelerate if there is more force applied to it since the ball is also heavier than a regular soccer ball. If there is very little force the bowling ball will not accelerate. Knowing that it will help children's body and teach them not to overuse their force if not needed.  \n\n3rd law (action-reaction): If you put a child on a swing you will notice how the force they use will be pushed back, but in the opposite direction. This activity represents Newtons third law of action-reaction, how for every action there is an equal but opposite reaction. This is very beneficial for kids since it does help their core muscles and teaches them to balance.\n\nOverall I think Newton's laws are needed to help children not gain strength but help them learn techniques. If children just learn or worry about their strength they will not know how to use it. Hopefully the games I provided will help children understand the concepts while still keeping them active. \n\n",
              "response": "I totally agree learning techniques is just as important, if not more important, than raw strength. Especially when it comes to injury mitigation, without understanding Newton's third law action-reaction a child might not realize that the force they are using will be exerted back on them. This means that we need to lean on proper form and techniques to absorb this energy as to not over stress our biomechanical joints."

Then I saw the picture of what seems to be a child floating in the water, and I remembered when I took swimming lessons, the instructor telling us that if we spread ourselves out like the child in the picture like a starfish, we can float the density of our body is distributed and not all in one place so the water is able to push from different directions to keep us a float and if we keep our bodies together like a little ball we will sink because all that weight is heavier kept together and not spread throughout the water make a starfish.",

It is a result of the Earth's mass attracting the mass of the log. The second force acting on the log is the buoyant force. This is an upward force exerted by the fluid (in this case, water) that opposes the weight of the log. According to Archimedes' principle, if the buoyancy force is greater than the weight of the log it will get pushed up and will float. If the buoyancy force is less than the weight of the log it will sink to the bottom. Consider the volume of the object. The volume of an object determines how much fluid it will displace when submerged. A larger volume means more fluid is displaced, and according to Archimedes' Principle, this means a greater buoyant force. Examine the density of the object. Density is defined as mass per unit volume (density = mass/volume). An object that is denser than the fluid will have a greater weight than the buoyant force and will sink. Conversely, if the object is less dense than the fluid, the buoyant force will be greater than the weight of the object, causing it to float.

It would be beneficial to maybe look under the hood one day. It wouldn't be fair to explain what I think those main parts are of a car battery since I'm not familiar. I do know that cables play an important role when needing to give another car/truck a jump. \n\n  Looking in my home and noticing how all the batteries have similarities. I noticed how all batteries have a negative and positive component. This is essential because that is how power operates, it needs an opposite to function. I think when the car is turned off properly, the battery charges. I know leaving a light on for several hours could cause the battery to die. Therefore, if your car is parked and turned off, this allows times for the battery to power on. \n\n",
              "response": "You're right about the need for opposites in electricity flow. However, the car battery actually charges while the engine is running, not when it's off. The alternator, which is part of the engine, generates electricity and charges the battery as the engine runs. Exploring under the hood can be a fascinating learning experience, so I encourage you to do that when you get a chance."

Envisioning regular AA and AAA batteries, they also seem to have the same parts. After reading up on this topic, I have found that the positive side is called an anode, the negative side is a cathode, and the chemical paste or plate is referred to as an electrolyte. A battery in our cars is charged by the alternator, which basically acts as a generator. The primary element involves the regulator. It regulates and controls just how much power is distributed from the alternator to the battery in order to control the charging process. I do believe that greater engine activity does charge the battery faster just based on what my dad has shown me when I have had a dead battery in the past. I also found an article discussing this, which states increasing the rpms of a vehicle will increase the voltage or power, making the alternator produce more charge for the battery. \n\nhttps://www.kwik-fit.com/blog/-does-car-battery-charge-while-idling#Links to an external site. \n\n",

The acid is a solution inside of the battery that causes the chemical reaction that gives off the power, or electrical energy. The positive terminal receives electrons and the negative terminal is where electrons originate. These components are all still present in AA and AAA batteries. Batteries have some energy when the car is not running because they are still able to power the lights and other small things. However the battery charges from the alternator while the car is running. Greater engine activity does not charge the battery faster.",

Just a small clarification: in a car battery, the positive terminal is actually where the electrons flow to, not from. So, it's more accurate to say that the electrons originate from the negative terminal and move towards the positive terminal. Also, while basic battery components like anode and cathode are similar in AA and AAA batteries, they don't have an acid electrolyte but usually a solid or gel-like substance.\n\n"

The lens focuses the light on the retina which has two different types of cells that respond to light called rods, activated when we are in dim light, and cones, which contain the color detecting molecules. The visible spectrum of light ranges from red to violet. When viewing pictures on monitors they rely on the primary colors red, green and blue mixed together to produce the shades of color we see. Pixels are the picture elements we view when many subpixels from the red, green blue combination combine that determine the final color that eye will perceive for a given pixel. \n\nWhen pictures are printed off a computer home printer they can tend to look not as bright as they do when they are on the computer and that is because we are viewing the original picture off of a very well lit computer screen. Most of the time the brightness on our screens are turned up high so we can visually see on the screen so we need to definitely consider that screen brightness is going to play a role in how we see the pictures on our computer screens to how they come without light physically on the paper when the are printed out.\n\n",

The visible spectrum of light ranges from red to violet, with red having the longest wavelength and violet having the shortest wavelength. When light hits an object, some wavelengths are absorbed and others are reflected. The wavelengths that are reflected are what we see as the object's color. For example, a red apple appears red because it reflects red light and absorbs all other colors. Our eyes have specialized cells called cones that detect different wavelengths of light. There are three types of cones: one for red light, one for green light, and one for blue light. These three colors are the primary colors of light, and all other colors can be created by mixing these three colors in different combinations. When we look at a computer screen, we are seeing light that is being emitted directly from the screen. The screen uses red, green, and blue pixels to create all the colors we see. When we print a picture, we are seeing light that is being reflected off the paper. The printer uses cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink to create colors.

Typically when we consider atoms that make up and elements two identical atoms are not the same since they have different electrons. The valence electron is considered the energy of the atom or the outer most layer. Bonding happens when a pair of electrons are shared by a single atom. When atoms start to bond they become more stable and in turn turn into a full electron. The only way the bond can be weak or unstable is if it comes in contact with water or close to it.",

This ended up being the beginning of the periodic table where horizontally they are arranged in increasing atomic number (originally mass) and vertically based on what chemical family they belonged to. This allowed future chemists and physicists to look at the table and theorize missing elements, knowing what their physical and chemical properties should be. There is also one other way that atoms could be different if their neutron counts change. When you add neutrons to an element what you get is an isotope, this could have gravely different properties and is sometimes radioactive and unstable enough to decay given enough time."

One other thing that tells us where black holes are, is they are so massive that they warp spacetime around them and cause something called gravitational lensing to happen.
